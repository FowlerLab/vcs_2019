#' Scale counts across batches
#'
#' Scale counts so that the average count within each batch is the same for each gene.
#'
#' @param ... Two or more log-expression matrices where genes correspond to rows and cells correspond to columns.
#' Each matrix should contain cells from the same batch; multiple matrices represent separate batches of cells.
#' Each matrix should contain the same number of rows, corresponding to the same genes (in the same order).
#' 
#' Alternatively, one or more \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} objects can be supplied containing a count matrix in the \code{assay.type} assay.
#' Note the same restrictions described above for matrix inputs.
#' @param batch A factor specifying the batch of origin for all cells when only a single object is supplied in \code{...}.
#' This is ignored if multiple objects are present.
#' @param restrict A list of length equal to the number of objects in \code{...}.
#' Each entry of the list corresponds to one batch and specifies the cells to use when computing the correction.
#' @param log.base A numeric scalar specifying the base of the log-transformation.
#' @param pseudo.count A numeric scalar specifying the pseudo-count used for the log-transformation.
#' @param subset.row A vector specifying which features to use for correction.
#' @param assay.type A string or integer scalar specifying the assay containing the log-expression values, if SingleCellExperiment objects are present in \code{...}.
#' @param get.spikes A logical scalar indicating whether to retain rows corresponding to spike-in transcripts.
#' Only used for SingleCellExperiment inputs.
#'
#' @return
#' A \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object containing the \code{corrected} assay.
#' This contains corrected log-expression values for each gene (row) in each cell (column) in each batch.
#' A \code{batch} field is present in the column data, specifying the batch of origin for each cell.
#'
#' Cells in the output object are always ordered in the same manner as supplied in \code{...}.
#' For a single input object, cells will be reported in the same order as they are arranged in that object.
#' In cases with multiple input objects, the cell identities are simply concatenated from successive objects,
#' i.e., all cells from the first object (in their provided order), then all cells from the second object, and so on.
#' 
#' @details
#' This function assumes that the log-expression values were computed by a log-transformation of normalized count data, plus a pseudo-count.
#' It reverses the log-transformation and scales the underlying counts in each batch so that the average (normalized) count is equal across batches.
#' The assumption here is that each batch contains the same population composition.
#' Thus, any scaling difference between batches is technical and must be removed.
#'
#' This function is equivalent to centering in log-expression space, the simplest application of linear regression methods for batch correction.
#' However, by scaling the raw counts, it avoids loss of sparsity that would otherwise result from centering.
#' It also mitigates issues with artificial differences in variance due to log-transformation.
#'
#' The output values are always re-log-transformed with the same \code{log.base} and \code{pseudo.count}.
#' These can be used directly in place of the input values for downstream operations.
#'
#' @section Choice of genes:
#' All genes are used with the default setting of \code{subset.row=NULL}.
#' Users can set \code{subset.row} to subset the inputs, though this is purely for convenience as each gene is processed independently of other genes.
#'
#' For \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} inputs, spike-in transcripts are automatically removed unless \code{get.spikes=TRUE}.
#' If \code{subset.row} is specified and \code{get.spikes=FALSE}, only the non-spike-in specified features will be used. 
#' All SingleCellExperiment objects should have the same set of spike-in transcripts.
#'
#' @section Using restriction:
#' It is possible to compute the correction using only a subset of cells in each batch, and then extrapolate that correction to all other cells.
#' This may be desirable in experimental designs where a control set of cells from the same source population were run on different batches.
#' Any difference in the controls must be artificial in origin and can be directly removed without making further biological assumptions.
#'
#' To do this, users should set \code{restrict} to specify the subset of cells in each batch to be used for correction.
#' This should be set to a list of length equal to the length of \code{...}, where each element is a subsetting vector to be applied to the columns of the corresponding batch.
#' A \code{NULL} element indicates that all the cells from a batch should be used.
#' In situations where one input object contains multiple batches, \code{restrict} is simply a list containing a single subsetting vector for that object.
#'
#' The function will compute the scaling differences using only the specified subset of cells.
#' However, the re-scaling will then be applied to all cells in each batch - hence the extrapolation.
#' This means that the output is always of the same dimensionality, regardless of whether \code{restrict} is specified.
