\usage{
cluster_cells(cds, reduction_method = c("UMAP", "tSNE", "PCA", "LSI"),
  k = 20, louvain_iter = 1, partition_qval = 0.05, weight = FALSE,
  resolution = NULL, random_seed = 0L, verbose = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{The cell_data_set upon which to perform clustering.}

\item{reduction_method}{The dimensionality reduction method upon which to
base clustering. Options are "UMAP", "tSNE", "PCA" and "LSI".}

\item{k}{Integer number of nearest neighbors to use when creating the k
nearest neighbor graph for Louvain clustering. k is related to the
resolution of the clustering result, a bigger k will result in lower
resolution and vice versa. Default is 20.}

\item{louvain_iter}{Integer number of iterations used for Louvain
clustering. The clustering result giving the largest modularity score will
be used as the final clustering result. Default is 1. Note that if
louvain_iter is greater than 1, the random_seed argument will be ignored.}

\item{partition_qval}{Numeric, the q-value cutoff to determine when to
partition. Default is 0.05.}

\item{weight}{A logical argument to determine whether or not to use Jaccard
coefficients for two nearest neighbors (based on the overlapping of their
kNN) as the weight used for Louvain clustering. Default is FALSE.}

\item{resolution}{Parameter that controls the resolution of clustering. If
NULL (Default), the parameter is determined automatically.}

\item{random_seed}{The seed used by the random number generator in
louvain-igraph package. This argument will be ignored if louvain_iter is
larger than 1.}

\item{verbose}{A logic flag to determine whether or not we should print the
run details.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to louvain-igraph Python package.}
}
\value{
an updated cell_data_set object, with cluster and partition
information stored internally and accessible using
\code{\link{clusters}} and \code{\link{partitions}}
}
\description{
Unsupervised clustering of cells is a common step in many single-cell
expression workflows. In an experiment containing a mixture of cell types,
each cluster might correspond to a different cell type. This function takes
a cell_data_set as input, clusters the cells using Louvain community
detection, and returns a cell_data_set with internally stored cluster
assignments. In addition to clusters this function calculates partitions,
which represent superclusters of the Louvain communities that are found
using a kNN pruning method. Cluster assignments can be accessed using the
\code{\link{clusters}} function and partition assignments can be
accessed using the \code{\link{partitions}} function.
