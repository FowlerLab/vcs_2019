\usage{
top_markers(cds, group_cells_by = "cluster",
  genes_to_test_per_group = 25, reduction_method = "UMAP",
  marker_sig_test = TRUE, reference_cells = NULL, cores = 1,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{A cell_data_set object to calculate top markers for.}

\item{group_cells_by}{String indicating what to group cells by for
comparison. Default is "cluster".}

\item{genes_to_test_per_group}{Numeric, how many genes of the top ranked
specific genes by Jenson-Shannon to do the more expensive regression test
on.}

\item{reduction_method}{String indicating the method used for dimensionality
reduction. Currently only "UMAP" is supported.}

\item{marker_sig_test}{A flag indicating whether to assess the discriminative
power of each marker through logistic regression. Can be slow, consider
disabling to speed up top_markers().}

\item{reference_cells}{If provided, top_markers will perform the marker
significance test against a "reference set" of cells. Must be either a list
of cell ids from colnames(cds), or a positive integer. If the latter, top_markers()
will randomly select the specified number of reference cells. Accelerates
the marker significance test at some cost in sensitivity.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print verbose progress output.}
